## GuardAutolayout

This iOS application is an implementation of the discussion regarding the use of the `guard let` and `if let` statements in the online tutorial: [Unwrapping Optionals](https://medium.com/@mimicatcodes/unwrapping-optional-values-in-swift-3-0-guard-let-vs-if-let-40a0b05f9e69)

In addition to implementing the code as stated in the tutorial, this Xcode project demonstrates using autolayot to position UI elements in the view. UIView components are positioned using autolayout so that they are correctly positioned in both portrait and landscape views. Constraints are visible in the image shown below.
